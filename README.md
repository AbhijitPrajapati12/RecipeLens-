RecipeLens streamlines the cooking process and enhances culinary creativity by integrating food ingredient detection with recipe suggestions. Users capture images of their ingredients, which are classified using the MobileNet_v2 model, known for its accuracy in image recognition. Once identified, RecipeLens accesses the Food Recipe API to fetch relevant recipes, ensuring the suggestions are valid and useful. Designed to be user-friendly for individuals with varying culinary expertise, RecipeLens simplifies the transition from ingredient identification to recipe discovery. This seamless integration empowers users to create diverse and exciting meals at home, making the most of their available ingredients efficiently and creatively.
